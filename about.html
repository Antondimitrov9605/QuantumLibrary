        <h1>About Quantum Library</h1>
        <p>Quantum Library is the fastest search engine for scientific publications and open-access research materials. 
        Our mission is to provide unrestricted access to knowledge for everyone.</p>
        
        <h2>Database Overview</h2>
        <p>Quantum Library currently provides access to over <strong>306,571,849</strong> scientific documents, freely available for search and retrieval.</p>
        <p>Approximately 80% of the database consists of research articles published in journals, 6% are conference papers, and 5% are book chapters. The remaining content includes diverse academic materials.</p>
        <p>Most research articles originate from medical and health sciences, followed by chemistry, biology, humanities, physics, and other fields.</p>
        
        <h2>Growth & Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>The database has expanded significantly over the years, with the largest growth occurring between 2013 and 2016. We continue to integrate new academic resources daily.</p>
        <p>Due to the increasing number of searches, our servers experience high loads. To sustain and expand our infrastructure, we rely on community support.</p>
        
        <h2>Supporting Open Science</h2>
        <p>We integrate with multiple open-access databases, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>arXiv</strong> - A repository for preprints in physics, mathematics, and computer science.</li>
            <li><strong>DOAJ</strong> - Directory of Open Access Journals covering all scientific disciplines.</li>
            <li><strong>CORE</strong> - Aggregator of millions of open-access research papers.</li>
            <li><strong>PubMed Central</strong> - Biomedical and life sciences publications.</li>
            <li><strong>Crossref Metadata</strong> - Indexing over 120 million academic papers.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>If you'd like to support our mission, consider making a <a href='donation.html' style='color: purple; text-decoration: underline;'>donation</a> to help sustain and improve our infrastructure.</p>
